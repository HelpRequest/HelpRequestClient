### User Journey

1. Authentication: The user may create an account and sign-in using Gmail, GitHub or email.
2. Profile and Payments: Once signed in, the user can edit the profile, add the technologies in which is willing to help other developers, and purchase credits using a credit card.
3. Create Help Request: Provide a description of the problem you are facing, include a code snippet and choose the related technologies.
4. Matching help requests: The help request will be broadcasted to other users who have the mentioned technologies among their expertise.
5. Video call: Once someone offers an help request, the user can accept it and engage in a peer-to-peer video call, with an option to share the screen for better assistance.
6. Reviews and Rewards: at the end of the call, both participants are prompted to review each other, and the person who asked for help has the opportunity to give a tip to the developer who provided help.
7. Rating and balance: The credits are then transferred to the other party's balance, the ratings are updated, and the help requests are indexed to the Past requests section.
